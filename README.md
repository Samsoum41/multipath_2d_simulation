# Multipath simulation

I made this project on my last year of preparatory classes. In the context of Li-Fi, I was studying with Cl√©ment Coste the noise resulting from multipath in the transmission of a light message between two points in a 2D grid. 

I reviewed the code I had written at the time of my project. At present, I preferred to exploit the Sympy library to make 2D geometry.
